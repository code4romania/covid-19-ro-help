In brief, starting from the analysis of the response in the case of Mexico or Italy, two countries that have had to manage response to a major earthquake recently (2017 and 2016, respectively) we realized that any fundraising effort during or after a major disaster comes together with a multitude of risks, including the sudden appearance of phantom organizations or focusing aid to just a few areas of intervention,, either thematic or geographical, according to the communication capacity of  NGOs in the field.
